# HighSierraMediaKeyEnabler

> MacOS High Sierra Media Key Enabler for iTunes

It only works with physical buttons, won't work with touchbar.

Download the compiled application here: http://milgra.com/downloads/HighSierraMediaKeyEnabler.zip

I don't have a developer certificate so trust the app when MacOS asks. Feel free to compile the project yourself.
